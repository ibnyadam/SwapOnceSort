Implement a Number of Data with One Swap  Operation

 –  Sorting  is  a  method  that  arranges  the  list  of 
elements  in  ascending  or  descending  order.  It  is  frequently 
used  in  a  large  variety  of  important  applications  used  by 
schools,  hospitals,  banks  and  in  many  other  organizations. 
There  are  many  sorting  methods  having  their  own  Time  and 
Space Complexity. This paper presents a novel sorting method 
named as SOS i.e. Swap Once and Sort. This method provides 
the correct position to an element by only one swapoperation. 
It is based on the  concept that, in  ascending orderlist, all the 
elements  after  a  particular  element,  will  be  greater  than  that 
element and vice versa for descending order list. Its algorithm 
is developed and then it is implemented in ‘C’. ItsC program 
is  run  for  random  data  set  of  size  1000-30000  with  the 
increment  of  5000.  For  comparison  purpose  two  parameters 
used  are  number  of  swap  operations  and  CPU  time  taken  to 
sort the given list. Comparison is performed with three existing 
popular  sorting  methods  Bubble  sort,  Selection  sort and 
Insertion sort. SOS takes lesser CPU time then all  these three 
sorting  techniques.  SOS  requires  lesser  number  of  swap 
operations  in  comparison  to  Bubble  sort,  Selection  sort. 
Insertion  sort  uses  shifting  of  data  rather  than  swapping 
concept
